abstract = "Abstract Theophrastus  is a system that supports the automatic 
annotation of (web) documents through entity mining and provides exploration 
services by exploiting Linked Open Data (LOD), in real-time and only when 
needed. The system aims at assisting biologists in their research on species 
and biodiversity. It was based on requirements coming from the biodiversity 
domain and was awarded the first prize in the Blue Hackathon 2013. 
Theophrastus  has been designed to be highly configurable regarding a 
number of different aspects like entities of interest, information cards 
and external search systems. As a result it can be exploited in different 
contexts and other areas of interest. The provided experimental results 
show that the proposed approach is efficient and can be applied in real-time."
